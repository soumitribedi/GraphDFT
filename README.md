# GraphDFT

This is a demo version of a PyTorch implementation of graph neural network to predict the exchange correlation energies and potentials of small molecules.

# Usage

python main.py

# Note
This is a demo version of the original project. Some important data has been removed/modified.
GEOM, rho_wf, vxc, gridwts files have been deleted from each molecule's folder in dataset
dataset.csv contains dummy exchange correlation energy values
Slater basis functions are used as the replacement of radial functions
